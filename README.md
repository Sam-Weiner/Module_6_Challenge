Data Visualization with PyViz

This project was designed to be an analysis of the SF real estate market to determine if there were opportunities for those looking to buy property and rent them out.  
The main target of this analysis was looking at the Sale Price of property by Square Foot, and comparing that to Rental Prices.  
By breaking the data down by neighborhood, the analysis was able to find different locations in the city that are potentially more profitable.
